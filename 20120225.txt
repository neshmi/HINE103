59 BCE - Governer of Asia, Lucious Valerious Flaccus
Finishes his term of office and returns to Rome
Always a dangerous period, he could be suited by the residents of the province for misdeeds and mismanagement (could not be suited while in office).  Flaccus hires (feels the need for) a good lawyer, hires Cicero.  Cicero publishes his defense of Flaccus.
